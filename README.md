Implementation of MS SQL Server Resolution Protocol, or MC-SQLR

I needed to find the port number of an MS SQL server on my network, and could not find a simple tool for the job. I _did_ find the [online documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/mc-sqlr/5d3c0525-bcfb-44ad-85b3-143cbeb9494f) and later [a nice PDF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/mc-sqlr/1ea6e25f-bff9-4364-ba21-5dc449a601b7) of the protocol used by the MS Server Management Studio.

Thanks to MS for very verbosely describing a _very_ simple protocol :-)
